In it, you'll find an exploratory analysis of the streaming platform movie dataset, exploration of missing values, individual distribution plots, and distribution of movies on each streaming platform. We have also discovered insights on genre, country, language, IMDb ratings, and movie runtime. Finally, we have built a recommender system in Python.
